   <h1>In Another World with My Smartphone
    異世界はスマートフォンとともに
   </h1>
   <img src="smartphone.jpg">
   <p>Fifteen-year-old Touya Mochizuki is accidentally killed by God via lightning. 
    As an apology, God allows him to be resurrected, but since he cannot send him back to his old world, he instead reincarnates him into a fantasy world along with any special requests. 
    Touya requested to bring his smartphone into the new world with him, which God accommodates with some modifications. 
    Although Touya is unable to contact his old world with it, the phone can be easily recharged by magic and can otherwise function such as accessing data from Earth and can use relevant features for his new world such as the GPS function to locations which are comprehensively identified, Internet access to the World Wide Web of Earth, and camera features.

    As a further apology for the inconvenience of killing him, God also greatly amplifies Touya's physical, magical, and cognitive abilities to a certain degree, making him an adventurer of overwhelming power. 
    Taking full advantage of his second chance at life, Touya befriends many different people, mainly women and high-ranking people in his new world, eventually having nine fiancées. 
    He begins to travel from country to country, solving political disputes, engaging in minor quests, and nonchalantly enjoying himself with his newfound allies.
     During his travels, he faces many monsters, villainous people, and powerful crystal creatures called the Phrase.</p>
